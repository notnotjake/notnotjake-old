				<p>It’s easy to become caught up in the everyday tasks of life. For days or even months, one can become a cog in the machinery of life, unable or unwilling to recognize their precarious position. When one loses their sense of agency, their sense of purpose, the world is in danger.</p>
				
				<p>Each person on this planet is unique. Not just now, but across all of time. Each person has unique thoughts, emotions, and experiences and a unique view of the world. Every individual has something unique and important to contribute to the world - as well as a profound responsibility. To lose one’s sense of purpose and agency is a loss for the entire world.</p>
				
				<p>Where does the future come from? One answer, derived from the greek ‘futurus’, is that the future is an extension of the past. This is useful for accountants. Next years sales will likely follow the trend of the year prior. However, this hardly predicts such amazing events as Apollo landing on the Moon, or such terrible things as the Holocaust. While seeds of these events lay in the past, no amount of historical knowlege would have predicted their occurrence.</br>
				So then where does the future come from? ‘Adventus’ is greek for a future which is arriving, and coming towards us. <em>This</em> future is open, unknown, and shaped by those individuals willing to confront it.</p>
				
				<p>A future shaped by the past is not an exciting future. It’s not a future that I want. A future shaped by bright, unique individuals, aiming for the highest good is an exciting future! It’s the future we should aspire to.</p>
				
				<p>My purpose in life is to help create such a future. Both in my own work and through inspiring others. What I can do is only so much, but by inspiring others, the future becomes exponentially brighter.</p>
				
				<p>What I care about is simple: <em><strong>creating delightful and transformative experiences</strong></em>.</p>
				
				<h3>Creating Experiences:</h4>
				
				<p>To impact the world you have to create or destroy. Destruction can be a noble act, but only in rare circumstances. Far more impactful is creating something. Creating something unique is a responsibility we have to the world as individuals.</br>Everything I want to create - apps, art, businesses, homes - are ultimately about experiences. The product exists dead, animated and given life by those who <em>experience</em> it. A beautiful home has no meaning until someone is able to experience it.</p>
				
				<h3>Delightful and Transformative:</h4>
				
				<p>The type of experience I want to create is one which lifts the human spirit.</br>
				Something delightful is also in some way surprising. Delight has the ability to shake someone out of a hum-drum state of mind and inspire them.</br>
				A transformative experience represents growth. A transformation is a change or movement from one place to another. This is fundamental to life and fundamental in meaning.</p>
				
				<h2>Creating Delightful and Transformative Experiences:</h4>
				
				<p>A Pixar film is a great example. It takes an enormous effort from hundreds of <em>unique</em> individuals to create a film like <em>Soul</em>. Pixar’s movies are incredibly delightful, surprising and inspiring viewers. They’re transformative experiences which can be seen by the amount of adults who cry at the films.</p>
				
				<p>Delightful and Transformative experiences are what life is made of. It can be as simple as a  pizza or as large as a family vacation.</p>
				
				<p>By <em>creating delightful and transformative experiences</em>, I hope to create a better future, and  inspire others to do the same.</p>
