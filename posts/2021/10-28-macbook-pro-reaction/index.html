				<p>The excitement for this event really crept up on me. I've noticed lately that Apple's pre-recorded, heavily-produced events just haven't gotten me excited, but I absolutely <em>loved</em> this event! Having listened to the rumors over the past year I had some idea what we might see, but I had no idea we'd see <em><strong>all</strong></em> of it.</p>
				
				<p>I've been using a 2015 15" MacBook Pro for the past six years or so. I ordered it only a month before the 2016 redesign&#8212;really dodged a bullet there. It's been an incredible laptop and one I was dreading having to replace. I really didn't want to give up my ports, MagSafe or a reliable keyboard (also glowing Apple logo). But with these all new MacBook Pros, Apple's brought back (almost) all of that, and has made a really strong statement about their commitment to professional users.</p>
				
				<p>These new MacBook Pro's look like everything I've wanted in a new MacBook Pro. I'll know fairly soon, once mine arrives. I cannot f***ing wait to get it&#8212;I'm so excited!</p>
				
				<h1>It Shouldn't Be This Exciting</h1>
				
				<p>Some of the exciting new stuff is, well, old stuff. I shouldn't be this excited to get ports and MagSafe, things I currently have, "back" on the new machine. Apple never should have taken those things away. It's been a dark couple of years for the Mac, but that makes the comeback that much more exciting to see. The Mac Pro's 2019 redesign was the first indication of real change, and now with this Mac, it seems like Apple's really gotten it's shit together. The Mac is back!</p>
				
				<p>For a while, every redesign Apple did on Mac hardware made the products worse. Now with the Mac Pro, Mac Mini, iMac 24", and now the 14" and 16" MacBook Pro Apple has proven it's listening to the needs of its customers and focusing on making great products again, and <em>that</em> is worth getting excited about.</p>
